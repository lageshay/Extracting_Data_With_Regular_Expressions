# Extracting_Data_With_Regular_Expressions
Assignment: Read through and parse a file with text and numbers. Extract all the numbers in the file, look for integers using the re.findall(), looking for a regular expression of '[0-9]+' and then converting the extracted strings to integers and compute the sum of the numbers. The file contains much of the text from the introduction of the textbook except that random numbers are inserted throughout the text. The numbers can appear anywhere in the line. There can be any number of numbers in each line (including none). Data File: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_276962.txt. From 'Python for Everybody' University of Michigan course via Coursera.
